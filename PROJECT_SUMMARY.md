## 🚀 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations and transitions
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful, customizable icons

### Backend
- **Next.js API Routes** - Serverless API endpoints
- **Prisma** - Type-safe database ORM
- **SQLite** - Lightweight database for development
- **Axios** - HTTP client for API requests

### External Services
- **WeatherAPI.com** - High-resolution weather data provider (1-11 km accuracy)

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Design System
- Dark theme with blue/cyan accents
- Glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- Responsive grid layouts

### User Experience
- Intuitive city search and management
- Real-time weather updates
- Loading states and error handling
- Hover effects and visual feedback
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Air quality information display

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Models
- **User**: User management (simplified for demo)
- **City**: City storage with coordinates
- **WeatherCache**: Cached weather data (future enhancement)

### Features
- Unique constraints for city/country combinations
- Proper relationships and foreign keys
- Timestamps for data tracking

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Weather API
- `GET /api/weather?city={city}&country={country}`
- Returns current weather and 5-day forecast
- Includes air quality data

### Cities API
- `GET /api/cities` - List all cities
- `POST /api/cities` - Add new city
- `DELETE /api/cities?id={id}` - Remove city

## 🚧 Known Limitations & Assumptions

### Assumptions Made
1. **User Authentication**: Simplified with default user ID for demo
2. **Coordinates**: Set to 0,0 for new cities (would be fetched from geocoding API in production)
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages
4. **Performance**: Optimistic updates and efficient re-renders

### Current Limitations
1. **API Rate Limits**: WeatherAPI.com free tier has 1 million calls/month limit
2. **Geocoding**: City coordinates are not automatically fetched
3. **Real-time Updates**: Weather data updates on page refresh
4. **User Management**: Single user system for demonstration

## 🔮 Future Improvements

### Short Term
1. **Geocoding Service**: Automatic coordinate fetching for cities
2. **Weather Alerts**: Push notifications for severe weather
3. **Unit Conversion**: Celsius/Fahrenheit toggle
4. **Search Suggestions**: Autocomplete for city names

### Long Term
1. **User Authentication**: JWT-based auth with user registration/login
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live weather updates
3. **Historical Data**: Weather history and trends
4. **Maps Integration**: Interactive maps with weather overlays
5. **Mobile App**: React Native companion app

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: Single column layout (320px+)
- **Tablet**: Two-column grid (768px+)
- **Desktop**: Three-column grid (1024px+)

### Features
- Touch-friendly interface
- Optimized for all screen sizes
- Consistent spacing across devices
- Adaptive typography
